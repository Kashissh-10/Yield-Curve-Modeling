# Project: Yield Curve Modeling in Excel

In this project, I developed a comprehensive Yield Curve Modeling tool in Microsoft Excel **(using Daily Treasury Par Yield Curve Rates)** to estimate and visualize interest rate term structures. The objective was to fit smooth yield curves to observed market data for better pricing, risk management, and financial analysis.

# Techniques Used: 
- Nelson-Siegel Model
- Nelson-Siegel-Svensson Model
- Linear Interpolation

# Key Highlights:
- Implemented the **Nelson-Siegel** and **Nelson-Siegel-Svensson** models for yield curve fitting using Excel’s Solver to optimize model parameters.
- Built a **Linear Interpolation** model as a benchmark for comparison against more advanced curve-fitting approaches.
- **Visualized yield curves** dynamically across different maturities with interactive charts and user-defined inputs.
- **Evaluated and compared model performance** based on fit accuracy and flexibility over various interest rate environments.

# Tools: 
Microsoft Excel, Solver, VBA (optional), Charting Tools

# Outcome:
This hands-on modeling project not only deepened my understanding of fixed-income analytics and term structure modeling but also showcased Excel’s powerful capabilities for financial modeling without relying on external tools.
